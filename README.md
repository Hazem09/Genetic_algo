### Applying genetic for the traveling salesman problem

This is a mini projet for my bechlor graduation project, it discusses applying the [Genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), on the [Travelling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

The program has a basic interface where you can input the hyperparameters for the algorithm, also input the matrix distances, it will output the best solution found and a graph visualising  the evolution of the best solution over iterations.
